# slotchatbotdocuments

A small repository for documentation, prompt templates, examples, and utilities for the Slot Chatbot project.

This repo contains a minimal smoke-test script `test.py` that prints a greeting so you can verify the environment quickly.

## Repository structure

- `README.md` — this file.
- `test.py` — small script that prints "hello world!" (quick smoke test).

Suggested folders you can add as the project grows:

- `docs/` — design notes and requirements
- `prompts/` — prompt templates and examples
- `examples/` — sample conversations and transcripts
- `scripts/` — helper scripts for development and testing

## Getting started

Prerequisites (only for development tasks; `test.py` requires Python 3):

- Python 3
- Git (optional)

Quick start (run the smoke-test):

```bash
python3 test.py
```

You should see:

```
hello world!
```
